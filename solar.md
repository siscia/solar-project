Multijunction cell are made of different layers, usually between 2 and 4.

Any layer is a simpler pn-junction that works as a normal, single junction cell.

Of course, several problem arise when we stack different junction on each other.

Specifically we are going to address how to let the energy penetrate between the first layers of a multijunction cell down to the last layer, and how to manage the current flow.

### Light Penetration

Light of specific wavelength does not interact with material that are not muliple of that wavelenght, this property is exploited to let light penetrate the first layer of a multijucntion cell down to the last layers.

To let the light be absorbed in the most efficient way the material with the smaller wavelength are stacked on top.

### Current Flow

As any other component the pn-junction need to obey to Kirckchoof law, this means that the current that flow into a junction must be the same that flow out of the junction.

To address this problem two main design emerged, the monolythich multijucntion and the stacked multijunction.

#### Monolythich

In a monolythich multijunction the different layer are stacked directly one on top of the other, and the current produce by any single layer must be extremely well tuned.

If a junction produce the wrong current it will act as load, heating the multijucntion cell itself, heading to a loose of efficiency, and consuming power directly.

#### Stacked

In a stacked multijucntion cell the different layers are completely isolated.

The problem of different current in different cell is avoided by design, but, as tradeoff, such cell required trasparent conctacts that are not ready yet.

The rest of the techinical exploration will so focus on the monolythich multijucntion cell.

## Basic stuff

Upper layer need to absorb the more energetic wavelength.

Up to four layer or cell.

Any layer is composed of the following:

1. Windows
2. Emitter
3. Base
4. BSF (Back Surface field)

## Component:

Windows: Used to reduce the surface recombination velocity.

BSF: Used to reduce the scattering of carriers towards the tunnel junction.

# How to compose the different layer:

## Different kind of MJ [1]

### Stacked:

Completely isolated block, they required trasparent contact.

Offer a better efficiency.

### Monolithic

Use tunnel junction to "link" the variuos block of the cell.

Lower efficiency since the power output and corrent of the several block must be syncronized, otherwise a cell will act as a load.

## Focus on the Monolithic type.

Necessity of the tunnel junction.


Definition to take care of:

Tunnel Junction: pn-junction of extremely high doped material, the bandgap between the two region is extremely low, almost no power loss.

Surface Recombination Velocity: A measure of the rate of recombination between electrons and holes at the surface of a semiconductor, equal to the component of the electron or hole current density normal to the surface divided by the excess electron or hole volume charge density close to the surface.
