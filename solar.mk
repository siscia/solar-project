Multijunction

## Basic stuff

Upper layer need to absorb the more energetic wavelength.

Up to four layer or cell.

Any layer is composed of the following:

1. Windows
2. Emitter
3. Base
4. BSF (Back Surface field)

## Component:

Windows: Used to reduce the surface recombination velocity.

BSF: Used to reduce the scattring of carriers towards the tunnel junction.

# How to compose the different layer:

## Different kind of MJ [1]

### Stacked:

Completely isolated block, they required trasparent contact.

Offer a better efficiency.

### Monolithic

Use tunnel junction to "link" the variuos block of the cell.

Lower efficiency since the power output and corrent of the several block must be syncronized, otherwise a cell will act as a load.

## Focus on the Monolithic type.

Necessity of the tunnel junction.


Definition to take care of:

Tunnel Junction: pn-junction of extremely high doped material, the bandgap between the two region is extremely low, almost no power loss.

Surface Recombination Velocity: A measure of the rate of recombination between electrons and holes at the surface of a semiconductor, equal to the component of the electron or hole current density normal to the surface divided by the excess electron or hole volume charge density close to the surface.
